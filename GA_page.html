          <h3>About Ethan</h3>
          <p>Hi, I'm Ethan, I am 19 years old with aspirations to be a web developer. I live in Alaska and enjoy biking, fishing, camping and music to name a few. I also have a new found intrest in writing code! I have been coding since the start of 2014 and have enjoyed the learning process and have found it to be a fiarly rewarding hobby. I started with writting static HTML/CSS pages and eventually began implementing Bootstrap into my projects as well for added style. About 2 months ago I also started learning Ruby through Codecademy which led me Ruby on Rails and the Rails for Zombies tutorials. I am familiar with MVC structure and can write some basic puzzle programs in Ruby. I want to be a part of the community and be a helpful person when completing a task by learning code down to the nitty gritty!</p>
